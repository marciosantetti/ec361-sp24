# Warning

<br><br><br>

.pull-left[

Learning this course's material may .hi[irreversibly] change the way you approach your own interests, and this fact may make it impossible to maintain your *current beliefs*.

]

.pull-right[

The learning journey may be very *stressful*, especially if you are not used to being .red[*frustrated].*

# About .mono[R]

This course will use .mono[R] for its applied lectures.

--

No previous knowledge in .mono[R] is required.

  - But in case you have .hi[no] experience with it, there is a .hi-slate[learning curve] ahead.
  - Make sure to have the most .b[up-do-date] version of .mono[R] (`4.2.2` or above).
  
--

<br><br>


Therefore, be *humble* and *patient* with yourself.

--

<br><br>

The next slide brings some .hi[useful resources].

# About .mono[R]

<br>

- [`R for Data Science (2e)`](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), by H. Wickham, M. Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and G. Grolemund

  - Work through its first section (chapters 1&mdash;8) to familiarize yourself with the `tidyverse`.
  
--

<br>

- [`Playlist with video lectures on R and the tidyverse`](https://github.com/marciosantetti/ec361-sp24/blob/main/README.md#r-basics), by yours truly, Prof. Santetti

  - Take your time and watch the videos at your own pace.



--

<br>

As a final word of .hi-red[advice], if you are not willing to go over the .hi-slate[discomfort] of learning new things, this course may .red[*not*] be compatible with your goals.

# What can be forecast?

# What can be forecast?

Some "forecasts" made in the past:

--

  - "*I think there is a world market for maybe five computers*." (Chairman of IBM, 1943);
  
  - "*Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons*." (Popular Mechanics, 1949);
  
  - "*There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home*." (President, DEC, 1977).

--


Despite the .red[*difficulties*] inherent to forecasting, this course will focus on the .hi[most reliable] methods for producing forecasts.

--

Our interest is on methods that:

  1. Are .green[*testable*];
  2. Are .green[*reproducible*];
  3. Have been .green[*shown to work*].



---

# What can be forecast?

As a mental exercise, think about the following events:

- Maximum temperature tomorrow;
- Time of sunset this day next year;
- Daily electricity demand in 3 days;
- Apple stock price tomorrow;
- The US/Euro exchange rate in 6 months.

--

<br>

Try to order these events in terms of .hi[forecasting difficulty] (from *easiest* to *hardest*).


---

# What can be forecast?

Some events are easier to forecast than others.

--

What determines such "easiness" depends on a few .hi[factors]:

.b[1]. How *well* we understand the factors that contribute to it;

.b[2]. How much data is *available*;

.b[3]. How *similar* the future is to the past;

.b[4]. Whether the forecasts can *affect* the thing we are trying to forecast.

# What isn't forecasting?


---

# What isn't forecasting?


Many times, someone may say they are forecasting something, but in fact they are not.

--

At this time, it is important to distinguish between .hi[forecasting], .hi-red[setting goals], and .hi-slate[planning] activities.

--

- .hi[Forecasting] involves predicting the future as .green[*accurately*] as possible, given all of the information available.
  - That includes using *historical* *data* and *knowledge* of any future events that might impact the forecasts. 


--

- .hi-red[Setting goals] involve thinking about what you *would like* to have happened.
  - Too often, goals are set *without* any plan for how to achieve them.



--

- .hi-slate[Planning] is a *response* to forecasts and goals.
  - It involves determining the appropriate actions that are required to make your forecasts match your goals.

# Final words

Now that we have touched on basic course logistics and basic concepts, a few .hi-slate[final words]:

--

<br>

- Take this course *seriously* and with *patience*;

--

- Accept the inherent *discomfort* that learning new things entails;

--

- Be *organized* with your course materials and, especially, with data files and .mono[R] scripts;

--

- The skills learned in this course can be *directly applied* in your future job(s) after graduating.
