**Data sets**:



1. [`New One Family Houses Sold: United States`](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HSN1FNSA)
2. [`Shares of gross domestic product: Gross private domestic investment `](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A006RE1Q156NBEA)



---



**Proposed practice**:



Start with the **investment share** series.



- Use only data starting from 1990Q1;
- Plot the data over time;
- Graph the ACF and PACF plots;
- Come up with possible ARIMA model specifications
- Select the best ARIMA model, minimizing the AICc criterion;
- Check the selected model's residuals;
- Compute a 8-quarter ahead forecast and graph it;
- Lastly, manually compute the 2 first point forecasts you have found with your selected method.



Moving on to the **houses sold** data:



- Plot the data over time, checking relevant features;
- Graph the ACF and PACF plots;
- Come up with possible ARIMA model specifications
- Select the best ARIMA model, minimizing the AICc criterion;
- Check the selected model's residuals;
- Compute a 24-month ahead forecast and graph it;
